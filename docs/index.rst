Learing to program using LED strips
###################################

About Moving Rainbow
==================
Moving Rainbow is a way to learn the basics of programming using LED strips.  We use low-cost components so
you can build an entire costume with 100s of LEDs for under $20

Getting Started
==================

Addressible LED Strips
----------------------
Addressible LED strips are easy to connect to your project since they only need three wires (Ground, +5V and data).
LED strip can be purchased on sites like ebay.com for under $5/meter of 60 RGB LEDs.
